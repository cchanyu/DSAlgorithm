This homework is due on Friday, December 6, 2019 

This is a group assignment. This work will submitted via a GitHub. 
To submit your work, email me a link to your GitHub repository. 
Make sure you cc your group members so that they know of your submission.
NO late work will be accepted.

Write a program that implements the following disk-scheduling algorithms:
- FCFS
- SSTF
- SCAN

Your program will service a disk with 5000 cylinders numbered 0 to 4999. 
The program will generate a random series of 1,000 cylinder requests 
and service them according to each of nth algorithms listed above. 
The program will be passed the initial position of the disk head 
and report the total amount of head movement required by the algorithm.
